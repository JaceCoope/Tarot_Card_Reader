1 "The Fool"
"The Fool is card 0 of the deck; the beginning. The card could mean anything from the start of a journey to having
limitless potential. The reason The Fool has no number is that the Major Arcana represents The Fool's journey through
life, meaning he is always present throughout the Major Arcana. Therefore, he has no particular place in the deck. On
his shoulders is a little knapsack on a stick, symbolizing only the burdens he NEEDS to carry, no more than that. He
stands on the edge of a cliff, not a care in the world as he marches on to a new adventure. He looks up in the sky,
almost in bliss, seemingly not realizing that he's about to step off; dropping into the unknown. The white rose in his
hand signifies innocence and purity; at his feet is a small dog that symbolizes loyalty and protection, the dog
encourages The Fool to keep moving forward, learn lessons in life. The mountains in the background represent the
challenges he's yet to face. He knows they aren't small and that they are ever-present, but right now he's focusing on
moving forward and starting the journey."
"The Fool, when upright, resembles the beginning of the journey that you took, and are potentially taking right now. It
encourages you to see how far you've come from where you started and how your leap of faith from the cliff affected
you."
