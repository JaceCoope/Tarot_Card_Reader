0 "The Fool"
"The Fool is card 0 of the deck; the beginning. The card could mean anything from the start of a journey to having
limitless potential. The reason The Fool has no number is that the Major Arcana represents The Fool's journey through
life, meaning he is always present throughout the Major Arcana. Therefore, he has no particular place in the deck. On
his shoulders is a little knapsack on a stick, symbolizing only the burdens he NEEDS to carry, no more than that. He
stands on the edge of a cliff, not a care in the world as he marches on to a new adventure. He looks up in the sky,
almost in bliss, seemingly not realizing that he's about to step off; dropping into the unknown. The white rose in his
hand signifies innocence and purity; at his feet is a small dog that symbolizes loyalty and protection, the dog
encourages The Fool to keep moving forward, learn lessons in life. The mountains in the background represent the
challenges he's yet to face. He knows they aren't small and that they are ever-present, but right now he's focusing on
moving forward and starting the journey."
"In your past, you decided you would start a new adventure in your life. Whether you decided to get an education, you
got a new job, or you might have even started a relationship. Whether it's any, all, or none of these things, you were
not sure where this path would lead you, but you took it anyway in good faith. Drawing this card upright might suggest
that you take a look at from where you started to where you are now"
"In the past, you may have been hesitant in taking risks. "What if it hurts?", "What it doesn't work out?", "What if it
never mattered in the end?" All these questions and more when it comes to looking at decisions; that is what the
Reversed Fool tells me. Asking those questions is never a bad thing, as it is human to be cautious. However, letting
them get in the way of your life is a whole other issue. Being cautious is good, but sometimes a risk is worth taking,
and will, not only lead you to succeed, you might even get more good than you expected. Or, perhaps, you were a little
TOO willing to make a leap of faith and ended up hitting solid rock instead of flowing water, figuratively speaking.
The Fool would encourage you to not brood over it but, rather, turn it into a life lesson. Learning from your mistakes."
"You might be at a cross-roads and need to make a decision. Perhaps you're putting your faith in something or someone
so that everything can work out. Regardless, drawing The Fool here in an upright decision encourages you to take a leap
of faith. Whatever you do, make sure you charge in with all you got. You may not know what will be at the bottom of the
 cliff; but if you don't, you might regret it."
"The Reversed Fool suggests, to me, that you might be at a decision you might not want to make. Perhaps it is a warning
for you to walk away from the situation. Another suggestion the Reversed Fool makes is that you might be tricked or
that the decision you are making is an unwise one. Perhaps it is a good idea to think about what you are doing."
"You will come across a point in your life to start a new journey; an opportunity for the taking. When the time comes,
take after The Fool and make a leap of faith. Whenever you see the opportunity, grab it. Even if you end up falling in
the beginning, you must absolutely make sure that you get back up and keep on going."
"The Reversed Fool suggests, to me, that you will be tricked, or that you may come to make a poor decision in life. Be
sure to exercise caution for the near future. Do not worry about it too much, as safety CAN be the enemy of progress.
However, if you hear something that sounds so good that it can't be true, it probably isn't."
1 "The Magician"
"The Magician is the first card of the Major Arcana; the official beginning of the Major Arcana set. The man in the card
 represents a connection between Heaven and Earth. With the tools he needs in front of him, the four suits, a cup; a
 sword; a pentacle; and a wand, he teaches us that, with our tools, we can achieve any desire that we want. You just
 have to be clever enough. The infinity symbol above his head represents infinite power. The snake can represent letting
  go of what you don't need or what hinders you in life. The flowers represent using your power with love and using the
  surrounding beauty around you."
"Drawing the Magician tells me that you found your talent or purpose in life. You know your style and what you're, for
sure, comfortable with. That's awesome! Take care however, not to become complacent with your place in life. A bit of
discomfort is good every now and again."
"Drawing this card in Reverse tells me that you are letting yourself become complacent and helpless of your own free
will. Perhaps you've found your power, but are now abusing it and becoming lazy with it; or maybe you're not sure what
your power is. If it's the first one, you must learn to realize what it feels like to be put through the fire and come
out stronger than before. If it's the second one, you might need to do an introspection. Find yourself and address your
problems. If the thi"
